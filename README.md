See issues for suggestions. And please, let's work together on this. :)

Right now, there's just a couple of simple pages created by two of our dojo members that touch on what technologies we use, where we meet, and a link to the Eventbrite page.

Next steps:

- [ ] link to zen for sign ups
- [ ] showcase of recent work
- [ ] general about info for parents, members, and volunteers
- [ ] link to Google Group / other discussion board
- [ ] Deploy it somewhere
